- Demonstrating Enhanced Performance in Python 3.11 vs 3.6 Using an N-body Simulation Script
- 
  This training session will showcase the improved performance of Python 3.11 over Python 3.6 by running an extended N-body simulation. The script calculates the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies, providing a computationally intensive benchmark to highlight the efficiency gains in Python 3.11.
